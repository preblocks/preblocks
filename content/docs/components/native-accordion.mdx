## Compatibility

This component leverages the `::details-content` pseudo-element for smooth transition animations. Please note that this pseudo-element was introduced in Chrome 131 *(released November 2024)*, meaning animations will not be visible in unsupported browsers. However, the component will still function correctly. You can check browser compatibility on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Selectors/::details-content#browser_compatibility).

Additionally, `details-content:` support is available starting from [Tailwind CSS v4.1](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-1#prettier-accordions-with-details-content).

## Comparing with Radix / shadcn

This component offers significant advantages in terms of **SEO**, accessibility, and reduced JavaScript dependency compared to Radix UI and shadcn/ui's Accordion. However, animation features rely on newer browser support.

| Feature | Native HTML Accordion | Radix / shadcn |
| :- | :- | :- |
| JavaScript Dependency | **None** (native HTML elements) | JavaScript library (Radix UI) |
| DOM Rendering | **Content always rendered in DOM**, hidden by CSS | Content often not rendered until expanded |
| SEO Benefits | **Semantic tags**, all content in initial DOM for crawlers | Content may not be in initial DOM |
| In-page Search | **Can automatically expand** when hidden content is found | Hidden content may not be searchable or auto-expandable |
| Accessibility | Inherently accessible due to native elements | Relies on WAI-ARIA implementation |
| Animation Support | Relies on newer browser features (`::details-content`) | Generally well-supported across browsers |
| Browser Compatibility | Core functionality works everywhere; animations require modern browsers | Broad browser support for all features |

## Add Registry

You can add Preblocks as a registry namespace in your `components.json` file located in your project's root directory.

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "@preblocks": "https://preblocks.com/r/{name}.json"
  }
}
```

Learn more about registry namespaces in the [shadcn documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry/namespace).

## Installation

Once the registry is added, you can install any block or component provided by Preblocks using the shadcn CLI.

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn add @preblocks/cta-1
```

```bash
npx shadcn add @preblocks/cta-1
```

This command will install the [first Call to Action block](/react/call-to-action). You can find the CLI command to copy for each block in its top-right corner.

## MCP Server

You can configure the MCP server using the [shadcn CLI's built-in functionality](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry/mcp).

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn mcp init
```
